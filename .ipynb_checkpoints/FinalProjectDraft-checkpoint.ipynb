    "### Question: What _really_ goes into the works of famous artists? \n",
    "When looking at a piece of art, it's hard to put a finger on what about the piece we find enjoyable, moving, or disturbing. When analyzing the work of artists, there's more that goes into their work than analyses of brushstroke patterns and color palettes. Using generative models, I've decided to look into the key features of the artwork of famous artists, hoping to uncover how our minds might generalize the works of Monet. This will help answer a rather complicated question, among other things: If I go to a museum and tell you that I saw a great Monet painting today, what mental image do you get?\n",
    "\n",
    "### DCGAN: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network\n",
    "I chose to use a generative model to distill the key features of artwork. By using an generative model, I am able to look at \"artwork\" the computer generates, to assess how the network has generalized features of the training artwork. \n",
    "\n",
    "A DCGAN is a generative model that uses unsupervised learning in training. Its specific architecture has made it relatively successful in learning from unlabeled data (Radford, Metz, & Chintala, 2015). The network consists of multiple convolutional layers and relies on the generative adversarial network (GAN) approach for training the network. \n",
    "![DCGAN diagram](./DCGAN.png)\n",
    "(_DCGAN diagram courtesy of https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow_)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the images generated by the model have no explicit target other than wanting them to look \"Monet-ish\", one might think it would be impossible to properly train! However, GAN has some tricks that make it possible. Alongside the generative network that is producing images, a discriminator network is being trained. This discriminator network is taking in the output images from the generator and asking \"Was this image generated or is it a training image?\" Then, the error from this _discriminator_ network is backpropogated both through the discriminator network _and_ the generator network, with the goal of making the discriminator network more likely to confuse training and generated images on the next epoch (https://blog.openai.com/generative-models/). Essentially, we want our real Monet images to become indistinguishable from our generated Monet images. Of course, in practice this won't happen. But what's interesting is that our DCGAN should generalize from our training data, thus answering (in part), my question of what makes a Monet, a Monet!\n",
    "\n",
    "I specifically chose a DCGAN for a few reasons. First, it's relatively easy to train. There are no labels required, and I can run 300 epochs of training on my personal laptop in just under 2 hours. Second, I found an existing implemenation of DCGAN on GitHub, using TensorFlow: https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you'll see here\n",
    "I'll include the code at the bottom of this notebook to run everything if you so wish. However, be advised that training takes a _really_ long time, and because the implementation runs from command line, a Jupyter Notebook isn't the best environment to work in."

To test how well it produces checkerboards, I will train a binary classifier at the end, trained on the same DCGAN checkerboards, and tested on the checkerboards that were generated by the DCGAN."

I noticed that incredibly different color palettes and subject matter was present in open scenes (landscapes and seascapes) versus closed scenes (people and flowers), and I hoped that by narrowing down the diversity in my dataset (although it resulted in a smaller set), would provide enough reglarity in the images to produce better end results.
